# Jucc But

Welcome to the repository for Jucc Bot, a bot created to help the [Jucc Eats Discord server](http://jucceats.com) function effectively.

## Installation

### **Prerequisites**

To get Jucc Bot running locally you must first have [`Node.js >= v18`](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io). You must also have a PostgreSQL server running.

### **Setting up your environment**

Once you have all of the prerequisites ready to go, next thing we'll do is set up your environment. First we'll clone our repository by running `git clone https://github.com/xPolar/jucc-bot`. Next we'll install our dependencies by running `pnpm i`. Once that's done we'll create our environment files by running `cp .env.example .env.dev && cp .env.example .env.prod && cp prisma/.env.example prisma/.env`. Now we'll open up our `.env.dev` file and fill in the values. Once that's done we'll open up our `.env.prod` file and fill in the values.
