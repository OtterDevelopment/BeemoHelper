# TypeScript Discord Boilerplate

Welcome to the template repository for my TypeScript Discord bots. Please feel free to use this template repository if wanted, please provide credit to this repository when doing so.

## Notes

If one of your interactions might take longer than three seconds to reply, you **must** use `interaction.deferReply(...)`, and then `interaction.editReply(...)`,
otherwise the interaction's token will invalidate and you will not be able to reply.
